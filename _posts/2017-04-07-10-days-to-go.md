title: 10 days to go - Finished Guessing Game 
categories:

---
After finishing the last Foundations checkpoint (which I found out I passed today!), I continued working on my simple number guessing game practice project. This week I added some [jQuery](https://jquery.com) code to tie in the JS functionality to the front-end portion I created 2 weeks before. Code School's [Try jQuery](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery) course really helped here.

It's pretty minimalistic, but you can play the game at **[this Github pages link!](https://marina-h.github.io/GuessingGame-Part3/)**.

For the last 2 weeks before the Grace Hopper program starts, there are no graded assignments but we are encouraged to work on the optional projects at our own pace and also get a head start on learning [Node.js](nodejs.org). I'm planning to make some improvements on the guessing game site as well as starting work on an actual portfolio site -- I'm sure I won't have much free time for that during the program.

### Next steps
- Start studying Node.js for the optional Part 5 of Foundations
- Work on creating a portfolio site!
- Continue with Codewars practice problems and reading [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
