title: My road to a coding bootcamp

### Short background

- I grew up with an interest in science through high school, especially biology. In college I took the obvious route of Biology major and worked at various research labs post-graduation.
- At some point I became interested in [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics), a field that applies computer science and mathematics to biological data. I ended up doing a Masters in Bioinformatics...
- ...but realized that I didn't want to continue working in the research field for several reasons. At the same time, I had some exposure to Python, SQL, R, and the command line which I enjoyed.
- This led me to look at coding bootcamps as a way to switch career tracks, but not before some trial and error:
  - I tried learning through online resources like [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) part-time after work but I felt that it would take me too long be job-ready.
  - I also tried an online bootcamp-like program that teaches Ruby on Rails called [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/) for ~ 4 months; I eventually ended my subscription to switch to an in-person program (more immersive and gives me more opportunities to network in the NYC area) but it was a great learning experience. I would highly recommend it to people who have the discipline/time to work through an online curriculum!

### Timeline to acceptance
Once I decided on in-person bootcamps, I looked at all the schools in NYC (since I live within commute distance) and applied to 5 schools between Feb 21-22: the Grace Hopper Program (GHP), Hack Reactor, App Academy, Flatiron School, and Dev Bootcamp.

My top choice was GHP, mostly because it has a tuition-deferred model like App Academy (you don't pay tuition until after you get a job!) but focused on JavaScript instead of Ruby like most bootcamps. I scheduled App Academy's technical interview a few days before GHA's since it would give me some practice with pair programming online (and all of the applications were free anyway).

Here's what GHA's application process looked like:

1. **A written application**. It wasn't anything complicated, but I did spend some time on my answers to their short answer questions (about my background, what I've tried so far in learning to code, etc.).

2. **Stage 1 coding assessment**. I was invited to take it the next day on Feb 23. It consisted of 5 easy-medium level questions on HackerRank (meant to be answered in JS or Ruby, I chose Ruby since I was more comfortable with it) to submit within 75 minutes. It wasn't too bad, especially after practicing common interview questions on [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com). I got an invitation to proceed to the next step 2 days after.

3. **Stage 2 interview**. A 60 minute Skype interview with an instructor at GHP which I scheduled for Mar 3. It consisted of a broad overview of the program, a couple questions about my background and motivation, 2 pair-programming questions (nothing out of the ordinary, maybe slightly more difficult than the Stage 1 questions), and a Q&A session. I was kind of nervous, but the instructor was super nice and didn't make me feel uncomfortable during any part of the interview. She even taught me a few new concepts :)

4. **Acceptance**! Apparently they liked my "critical thought process, problem-solving skills and positive attitude throughout the interview stages". I got the email on Mar 5th and promptly decided to withdraw my applications for the other schools.

### Helpful resources (in no particular order)

- [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com) - My main resource for coding problem practice. I only finished about half of the Easy and ten of the Medium questions before applying though. One negative is that testing inputs is relatively difficult on their site so I copied the questions and tests to [repl.it](https://repl.it/). Another is that answers from other students are available but difficult to browse through and are not ranked by helpfulness like Codewars.

- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) - Useful for practicing solving more small problems. I've only tried 8-6kyu problems so far using Ruby, sometimes in JS.

- [Practical JavaScript course at Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) - Very informative free video course by Gordon Zhu that doesn't assume prior JS knowledge and guides you through the development of a simple Todo web app using test driven development (TDD) techniques. It was a good way to review JS concepts after focusing on Ruby for a while too.

- [Cracking the Coding Bootcamp â€“ The Definitive Guide](http://haseebq.com/cracking-the-coding-bootcamp-the-definitive-guide/) - Although I didn't end up going to App Academy (which the author Haseeb went to), this blog post was a great step-by-step guide about the whole process of committing to a attending a bootcamp and prepping for the interviews.

I also tried and liked the two (currently) free online prep courses offered by bootcamps:

- [Flatiron School's bootcamp prep course](https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-bootcamp-prep-course/) - Good for practicing basics of JS and Ruby while getting exposure to TDD, as a bonus you get to commit all of your answers to Github and make small games to play around with.

- [Hack Reactor's prep course](http://www.hackreactor.com/prep-programs/) - Helped solidify JS concepts and had helpful tips on testing and dealing with the stress during interviews. There is also a paid version of the course (currently $495) that gives you bonuses like access to code reviews from the staff, but I didn't use it.

### Next steps
- I'll be starting the Foundations online prep course this Friday, which is 5 weeks before my cohort's start date.
- I should focus on learning JS concepts, since I've been practicing coding problems in Ruby.
