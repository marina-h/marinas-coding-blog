title: 37 days to go - Starting Foundations
categories:

- In the past few days I've worked through the pre-access course (which I discovered is actually the same as Foundations Part 1), which was a nice review of basic concepts like using the command line to manipulate files and getting comfortable with git.
- The main part of the course is a collection of mini-lessons on important JavaScript concepts. All the functions I will be writing for this part of the course will be tested using the [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework, so I'll be getting a lot of experience reading tests.

- Also...as a nice bonus from Fullstack Academy, I got a free subscription to [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com) for the duration of the bootcamp :)
