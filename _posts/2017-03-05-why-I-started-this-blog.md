I recently made the decision to attend a full-time coding bootcamp in NYC called the [Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy](https://www.gracehopper.com), and decided to start a simple blog to keep a record of my experiences as I go through the course and (hopefully) get a developer job. 

In the next post I'll briefly explain my journey from research scientist to coding bootcamp student.
