title: 12 days to go - Finished Final Foundations Checkpoint
categories:

Finished the last graded portion of the Foundations curriculum on Sunday. It went by so fast! This week we're focusing on using jQuery to tie in the JS we worked on last week to the front end for the guessing game site. I've briefly worked with jQuery in the past (for example, the front end freecodecamp projects), but haven't learned it too deeply so I'm looking forward to it.

### Next steps
- Continue working on the number guessing game site
- Do more Codewars practice problems
- Start rereading [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) to review topics like closure, scope, and 'this'.
