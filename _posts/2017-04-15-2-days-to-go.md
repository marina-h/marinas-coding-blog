Only 2 days to go until I start learning web development full-time! The past 4 weeks went by so quickly, especially because I continued working for my job until yesterday (not ideal, but I needed to wrap up projects before leaving). Since I didn't have much time to review the optional Node.js work this week, I will try to study today and tomorrow. 

Yesterday I got an email from Grace Hopper describing what to expect on the first day in class and recommending going through the "Data Structures" and "Toolbox" workshops online. I'll have to make time to set up my computer in the recommended fashion (install the [Z shell](http://www.zsh.org/), set up [ESLint](http://eslint.org/), etc). My text editor of choice now is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which Fullstack seems to like as well. 

### Next steps
- Watch prep videos on Data Structures (stacks and queues, linked lists, binary search trees, and hash tables)
- Finish setting up dev environment and reviewing Node.js basics
- Get some rest before Monday!
