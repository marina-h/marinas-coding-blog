title: 29 days to go - Finished Foundations Part 1
categories:

---

I finished my first checkpoint this Friday! A lot of JS was covered in this first week, but most of the concepts weren't completely new to me which made the learning process easier.

Some of the concepts covered in Part 1 include:
- Getting comfortable with Git (completing the CodeSchool course [Git Real](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real) also helped).
- Learning how to read test specs written in [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and run them using [testem](https://github.com/testem/testem), which was pretty straightforward and kind of fun once I used it a couple times.
- Lots of practice working with objects, including arrays and functions. Using Chrome's developer tools and the `debugger` command really helped here.
- Factory functions using closure to keep track of hidden variables.
- Constructor function and the `new` keyword.
- Ways to looping through object properties while avoiding ones on the `.prototype` chain.

### Next steps
- Now I'm moving on to Part 2, which covers topics like functional programming, prototypal inheritance, recursion, and async JS. I also start working on the HTML/CSS portion of a small number guessing game!
