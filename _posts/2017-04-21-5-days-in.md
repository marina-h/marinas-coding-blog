title: Day 4 - Finishing the Game of Life, introduction to Node.js
categories:

Finally reached Friday, but optional remote-only courses (CS Saturdays) are held between 10:30AM-6:30PM on Saturdays so unfortunately I'm not free for the weekend. I might just watch the lectures and not join the pair programming in the afternoon if I feel too tired though.

We continued working on the Game of Life for a while before the review, when an instructor held a live coding session to demonstrate his approach to building the project. It was pretty helpful to see how he thought through the steps involved in updating the status of the whole 12 x 12 board (1. read the state of the board, 2. calculate what the next state should be, and 3. apply the new state to the board).

Since it was Friday, we stopped working on coding problems at around 4:30 and spent time on fun social activities with the seniors (students in the 2nd phase of the program).

### Topics covered:
- Some ES6 syntax such as `let`, `const`, and arrow functions
- Node.js:
  - the `process` object
  - exporting and importing modules
