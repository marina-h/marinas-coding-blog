Another packed day. We spent a couple hours on sorting algorithms and Big O notation, which a pretty importance concept in computer science. I learned some of the many ways to sort arrays (with a focus on bubble sort and merge sort) with different worst case running times, but also learned that even inefficient algorithms may be OK if you are only using small inputs).

There was also a short lecture on basic cellular automata concepts before we pair programmed on an implementation of Conway's Game of Life. It was cool seeing how complex patterns can appear from simple rules that decide whether a cell is 'alive' or 'dead'.

### Topics covered:
- Sorting algorithms
  - Bubble sort (O(n^2)) and merge sort (O(n log n))
- Big O, theta, and omega
- Conway's Game of life
