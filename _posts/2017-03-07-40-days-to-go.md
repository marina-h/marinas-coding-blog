- I submitted the $3000 deposit (in person) to secure my seat in the April 17th cohort for the Grace Hopper Program! A few hours later I got the email that gave me access to the Foundations prep course. According to the [Fullstack Academy website](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/software-engineering-immersive#syllabus) (the programs share the same curriculum),

> Foundations is a 30-hour per week prep course that you will take for the first 4 weeks. You will work through the Foundations material on your own pace, to get ready for the live portion of the immersive that starts in week 5.

- I was also able to join the Fullstack Academy organization on Github as well as the team for my cohort today.
- Since Foundations for my cohort officially starts this Friday, I can't access the material yet but apparently there is a short intro course I can take now called Foundations Pre-access. I'll be sure to finish it in the next few days.
