The second day was just as exhausting as the first, but I'm having a good time learning and getting to know more of my classmates. We even got a link to an iOS 'name game' app called Name Shark that can quiz us on our classmates' names and faces.

My pair programming partner and I struggled to grasp the usage of recursion to traverse binary search trees, but by the end of the day we kind of figured it out. Tomorrow we will continue working on it and also implementing a hash table data structure.

The last activity for the day was a Jeopardy-like game where the class was split into groups and got tested on our knowledge of topics like JS history, HTML, CSS, and Grace Hopper Academy.

### Topics covered:
- More data structures
  - hash tables
  - binary search trees
