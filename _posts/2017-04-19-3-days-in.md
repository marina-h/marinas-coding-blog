Today was a pair programming-heavy day. In the morning, my partner and I continued to work on the hash tables and binary search tree implementation from yesterday before watching a review video on it. I'm getting slightly more comfortable with traversing trees using recursive and iterative approaches, but it's still a difficult topic.

We changed partners for the afternoon session where we created a simple clone of the jQuery `$` selector function. Traversing the DOM without any helper methods (ex. `getElementByID`) was rather painful, and gave me a new appreciation for libraries that simplify this process.

Tomorrow we will cover sorting algorithms such as bubble sort and merge sort.

### Topics covered:
- Review for hash tables and binary search tree workshop
- The DOM and traversing its tree structure
- Chrome dev tools
