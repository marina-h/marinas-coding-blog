My first day in class is over! It was pretty exhausting even though half the day was spent on non-programming related activities like introducing each other (there were ~23 people total in my cohort) and discussing the code of conduct.

After some lectures on the basics of computers and data structures, we spent the last few hours of class from around 3:30PM to 6:30PM on pair programming with a randomly selected partner to work on implementing queues and linked lists in JavaScript. Me and my partner managed to make all the tests pass so then we spent some time refactoring our (very repetitive) code.

### Topics covered:
- History of computers and information theory
- Abstract Data Types (ADT) and Data Structures (DS)
  - queues
  - linked lists

### Next steps
- Review data structures lecture slides
- Review pair programming concepts (driver and navigator responsibilities)
