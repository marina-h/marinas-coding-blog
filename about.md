Hi I'm Marina, a research scientist-turned-aspiring full-stack developer. I'm a student in the April 2017 cohort at the [Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy](https://www.gracehopper.com).

I'll be updating this section more as I progress through the course.

You can contact me here if you'd like to send a message:
